#Metaclasses in Python provide a way to customize the creation and behavior of classes. 
#A metaclass is a class of a class that defines how a class behaves. When a new class is created, its metaclass determines how it's structured and behaves. 
#Metaclasses are often used for code generation, enforcing coding standards, or performing actions during class creation.

#Here's a basic example to illustrate the mechanics of a metaclass:

# Define a metaclass
class MyMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        # Customize the class creation process
        print(f"Creating class: {name}")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

# Use the metaclass to create a new class
class MyClass(metaclass=MyMeta):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def display(self):
        print(f"Value: {self.value}")

# Creating an instance of MyClass
obj = MyClass(42)
obj.display()
